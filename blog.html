            Discussion of the scope of var, let, and const
          </h1>
          <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 text-justify my-7">
            JavaScript, like plenty more up-to-date styles, provides a host of
            various patterns for changing proclamation. JavaScript has the var,
            allow and const keywords for changeable declarations and with each
            comes a various use case. This item aims to eat a lot-insight into
            the warnings and shadings which you power encounter when utilizing
            either of these changing proclamation patterns. For a bit more
            context, visualize the definitions of each of the keywords as
            outlined in the official ECMAScript requirements and MDN. Var magic
            words for entry declares a changeable that is scoped to allure
            current killing framework, needlessly initializing to a profit. Let
            magic words for entry declares a block scoped changeable, needlessly
            initializing it to a profit. Const magic words for entry declares
            limit that are block scoped much like variables delimited utilizing
            allow but the advantage of a loyal cannot change. The const
            declaration devises a state-only remark to a advantage.

            Use Cases Of Null And Undefined

            In JavaScript, two together ineffectual and infinite represent the
            dearth of a worth. However, they have specific use cases and
            attitudes. Let's investigate the details accompanying models:
            <span class="text-2xl font-semibold text-cyan-700 my-6"
              >Undefined in JavaScript</span
            ><br />
            infinite is a barbaric advantage that displays a changing has been
            asserted but not appointed some advantage. It's the default worth
            for uninitialized variables and function limits. When achieve an
            object feature or array element that doesn't survive, it results in
            infinite.
            <span class="text-2xl font-semibold text-cyan-700"
              >Null in JavaScript </span
            >br ineffectual is an appointment value that shows the deliberate
            dearth of any object profit. It's frequently used to indicate that a
            changeable endure have no advantage or to reset a changing. Unlike
            infinite, valueless is explicitly appointed.

            About REST API
          </h1>
          <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 text-justify my-7">
            REST signifies REpresentational State Transfer. It is a standard
            that guides the design and happening of processes that authorize us
            communicate accompanying dossier stocked on a netting servers.The
            above description concede possibility not look as complex or
            "professional" as the one you encounter connected to the internet,
            but the aim in this place is for you to learn the fundamental
            purpose of REST APIs.An API that gives up accompanying few or all of
            the six leading restraints of REST is deliberate expected RESTful.We
            are smart to ideas accompanying servers utilizing the HTTP code.
            With these obligations, we can Create, Read, Update and Delete
            dossier alternatively famous as CRUD movements.But in what way or
            manner can we act these CRUD movements and write accompanying
            dossier on the attendant?We grant permission this by shipping HTTP
            requests, what is place REST enters place. REST reduces the ideas
            process by providing miscellaneous HTTP
            patterns/movements/participles that we can use to transmit requests
            to the attendant.
